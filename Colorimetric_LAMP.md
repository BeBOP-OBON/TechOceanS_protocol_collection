# Colorimetric LAMP Standard Operating Procedure

## Colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)

1. Prepare LAMP primer mix to simplify setting up reactions. For 10X primer mix, combine 4μl of the forward inner primer-FIP (16 μΜ), 4μl of the backward inner primer-BIP (16 μM), 0.5μl of the forward outer primer-F3 (2 μΜ), 0.5μl of the backward outer primer-B3 (2 μΜ), 2μl of loop-forward primer-LF (8 μΜ), 2μl of loop-backward primer-LB (8 μΜ), and 12μl molecular grade water.

| **Primer** | **10X Concentration (stock)** | **1X concentration (final)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FIP | 16 μΜ | 1.6 μM |
| BIP | 16 μΜ | 1.6 μM |
| F3 | 2 μΜ | 0.2 μM |
| B3 | 2 μΜ | 0.2 μM |
| LF | 8 μΜ | 0.8 μM |
| LB | 8 μΜ | 0.8 μM |

1. Combine 2.5μl LAMP primer mix (10X), 12.5μl WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 6.5μl molecular grade water. Vortex and centrifuge mix.
2. Transfer 21.5μl to 0.2ml PCR tube.
3. Add 1μl DNA and 2.5μl GuHCl (40mM adjusted to pH 8.0). Vortex and centrifuge reaction.
4. Add 15μl mineral oil to avoid evaporation of the reaction.
5. Incubate at 65°C for 60 minutes in the Pebble device (BIOPIX-T).
6. Colour change measurements are taken every 0.1 minutes and displayed as a change in colour index.
7. Ensure positive and negative controls are also carried out.
