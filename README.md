# TechOceanS_protocol_collection
A repository to host the biomolecular protocols generated by the Technologies for Ocean Sensing (TechOceanS) Project: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101000858

These protocols are being created using templates developed during TechOceanS, which can be converged with the BeBOP protocol templates during future development. 

The `odis_metadata` directory contains JSON-LD + schema.org formatted metadata for the protocols in this collection, which will be harvested by the Ocean InfoHub (OIH) / Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS) initiatives of the IODE (https://oceaninfohub.org/). 

In some cases, the `odis_metadata` directory will include JSON files for protocols which are not yet publicly released. The intent is to provide BeBOP partners and users with a preview of content to come, and allow pre-release contact with authors, in support of accelerated biomolecular ocean sensing.
