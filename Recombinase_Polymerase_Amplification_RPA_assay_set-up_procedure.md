## 2.0 Executive Summary / Abstract

This document provides a Standard Operating Procedure for the
preparation of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification reaction mixtures
using a standard molecular laboratory set-up. It describes the process
and formulation required to set up an individual RPA reaction using the
reagents available in the TwistAmp Liquid Exo kit, available from
TwistDx Ltd. The method has been optimised at the National Oceanography
Centre and is suitable for the real-time amplification of a varieity of
DNA sequence targets.

## 3.0 Introduction

Recombinase Polymerase Amplification is a technique in molecular biology
for the rapid and selective amplification of a DNA target sequence in an
aqueous DNA sample. It is an example of an 'isothermal' DNA
amplification method, which can be distinguished from the more commonly
used Polymerase Chain Reacrtion technique because it does not require
high reaction temperatures (\>90^o^C) or themal cycling to achieve the
amplification of a DNA sequence. RPA reactions are efficient at
temperatures ranging from 25 to 40^o^C. Otherwise, the technique is very
similar to PCR, and the reagents and reaction set-up process are very
similar, however the design of oligoncuelotide 'primer' and 'probe'
sequences must be considered carefully because PCR primers rarely work
well with the RPA chemistry. RPA can also be used to amplify a sequence
from RNA if used in combination with Reverse Transcription (not covered
by this document). RPA technology is proprietary to TwistDx Ltd.

## 4.0 Method

1.  Working in a suitable isolation hood, prepare the workstation by
    decontaminating all surfaces and equipment with a suitable process,
    e.g. UV radiation or Nuclease and DNA removal agent.

2.  Remove the TwistAmp Liquid Kit from storage at -20oC, place the Core
    Reaction Mix (CRM) component and Exonuclease (Exo) component on
    crushed ice. These should remain on ice throughout the set-up.

3.  Place the remaining kit components at room temperature and allow
    them to thaw fully. Vortex mix each component (excluding the CRM and
    Exo).

4.  Nucleotides (dNTPs) are not provided in the RPA kit despite the
    significant price point. Therefore, dNTPs should be purchased
    separately and made to a concentration of 10 mM each of dATP, dTTP,
    dCTP and dGTP (40 mM total) before use. dNTPs should be stored in
    water or 10mM Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) at -20^o^C until used. Avoid
    excessive freeze-thaw cycles (store in aliquots).

5.  RPA primers and 'Exo' probe should be prepared to a working
    concentration of 10 Î¼M in either molecular-grade water or 10mM
    Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) and kept at -20^o^C until use. Exo probe should
    be stored in an opaque tube and protected from, unnecessary light
    exposure (photosensitive reagent). Avoid excessive freeze-thaw
    cycles (store in aliquots).

6.  Working with aerosol-barrier tips and micro pipettors, prepare RPA
    reaction mixtures in Nuclease-free 0.2 mL tubes with lids. For large
    numbers of parallel reactions, tube and cap strips may be
    preferable.

7.  Prepare reactions as per the table below, adding each component in
    order and following the notes at the foot of the table.


  **Component** | **Volume (microlitres)/reaction)**| Comments
---|---|---
Forward Primer (at 10mM) | 1.05 | --
Reverse Primer (at 10mM) | 1.05 | --
Probe (at 10 mM) | 0.3 | --
2X RPA Reaction Buffer | 12.5 | --
dNTPs (10mM ea., 40mM total) | 1 | --
Molecular Water | 2.6 | --
Probe E Mix | 2.5 | --
20X Core Reaction Mix | 1.25 | Add to the lid of the tube with the Nucleause mix, and mix by inverting 10 times, then spin briefly. |
Nuclease (Exo) mix | 0.5 | Add to the lid of the tube with the Core Reaction Mix, and mix by inverting 10 times, then spin briefly. |
**Sub-Total Volume** | **22.75** | --
Template | 1 | Add to one side of the lid.
MgOAc | 1.25 | Add to the side of the lid opposite to the Template, close, then spin the tube briefly to initiate the reaction.
  **Total Volume** | **25** | --



8.  Place the reactions into a thermal cycler or water bath and incubate
    at 25-40^o^C for 30 minutes. The specific temperature and duration
    will depend upon the specific assay being used. Generally, 37^o^C
    for 20 minutes will suffice.
